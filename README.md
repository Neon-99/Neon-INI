Apply the INI in-game by typing exec X (with the X being a number from the list below)

# INI Settings

• INI Setting 1 (exec 1) disables water reflections, and makes minor behind-the-scenes performance improvements

• INI Setting 2 (exec 2) disables water, cloud, fog and foliage shadows and lowers the overall quality to a just-about-playable™ look

• INI Setting 3 (exec 3) disables all mesh and foliage material, disables all shadows and most particle effects. This results in a poor, barren landscape meant only for **absolute garbage** computers, would not recommend for any sane individual

(More settings will be added in the very near future, including a no water INI and no tree INI)


# Known Issues

• The file will be flagged as a virus and requires you to disable your antivirus, i can assure you that my INI isn't malicious and i am working to find a solution

• Switching from different INI settings while in-game will cause the foliage and mesh textures to be replaced with the UE5 'no material' texure, this is an engine limitaion and as such i cannot do much to prevent this, though it does increase performance xD, a fix for this is to leave and rejoin the server, or only switch INI settings while at the main menu
