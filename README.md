Hey there, I'm neon and I am a programmer based in the UK, this is my first GitHub repository dedicated to my upcoming INI project for ASA. Right now, it has limited functionality and only works for the Steam version of ASA, but I plan for windows support soon and will be porting lots of functionality to a cross-platform mod for Xbox when I become more well-versed with the ark DevKit.
